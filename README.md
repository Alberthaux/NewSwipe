# NewSwipe
This project aims at giving a daily brief of world news. 
- The steps are the following: 

- Scrap 8 newspapers titles on home page.
- Cluster the titles using tf-idf and dbscan, using a custom distance
- Locally save a summary of an article within each cluster, with picture attached and links to other articles of the same cluster
-  Display the article in a smooth swiping interface allowing you to display in the end only the aricle that the user likes
